Game Overview
Game Concept
Forever Home follows the adventures of Uncle Jack as he chases his niece’s sneaky cat through her inaccessible home. Uncle Jack is tasked with making the right choices in order to turn this inaccessible home into an accessible one in order to finally catch the cat and get the keys back from the cat. As he moves through the home, inaccessible parts will block his path, forcing Uncle Jack to select which modification will allow him to continue on his quest. Uncle Jack will be constrained by a budget, forcing him to make smart decisions. Points will be distributed based on which modification Uncle Jack chooses, complete with an explanation on why he may or may not have received the most points possible. Uncle Jack will encounter 5 different scenes, each with an inaccessible obstacle that he needs to overcome before being able to chase the cat into the next scene. The goal of the game is to overcome all the obstacles possible while minimizing the number of times Uncle Jack needs to call his niece home from her activities in order to help him and staying within the budget.

Target Audience
The target audience for Forever Home are individuals looking to update either their or a loved one’s home in order to make it more accessible. Therefore, our player profile is a 40+ year old person experiencing the inconveniences that come with an inaccessible home. They may not know much about how to make their home more accessible, and are therefore visiting the Accessible Design and Build website in order to learn more about their options and what products/services are out there that can help them make necessary accommodating modifications.

Genres
Education, Quest, Adventure, Puzzle

Purpose of the Game
The purpose of Forever Home is to educate Accessible Design and Build site visitors on how they can transform their inaccessible homes into accessible ones. The game will visually depict some of the obstacles that cause homes to be inaccessible as residents age, allowing players to draw parallels between the game universe and their own home. Ultimately, players will become more aware of the inaccessible elements of a home and will be motivated to use the Accessible Design and Build services in order to make their home more accessible.
Look and Feel
This game will be a web-based, 2D game on the Accessible Design and Build website. Animations will show the transitions between scenes by following the cat as it moves throughout the house. The game will be controlled via the mouse and will feature simple options for players to click in order to navigate through the game. When a modification is selected at each level, there will be a small construction animation that will transition the old layout of the house to the new look with the modification. The design of the game will look fairly cartoon-like, but will try to maintain a professional and realistic depiction of a home. Both Uncle Jack and the cat will match the animation style of the house. Uncle Jack will appear as a relatable, friendly person while the cat will be more sneaky and snarky.

Intended Use
This game is intended to educate people on the elements in their home that make it inaccessible for either themselves or loved ones that come to visit. The result of this education will be a motivation of the players to purchase Accessible Design and Build services in order to make the necessary modifications in their home in order to make it accessible.
Gameplay
Objectives
To catch the cat that stole the keys by successfully overcoming inaccessible obstacles through accessibility modifications.

Game Progression and Play Flow
There will be 5 different scenes presented to the user in which they will need to determine how to overcome the inaccessible obstacle in order to make it to the next scene. The player will move on to the next scene once they have made a selection of how to overcome the obstacle. The transition to the next scene will follow the cat that stole the keys out of the current room and into the next, at which time a new obstacle will be presented. Once the player has successfully completed every scene, they will get the keys and receive a comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of the choices they made. At this time, the player will get the option to replay the game with either the same or a different budget in order to improve their performance. They will also be given the choice to go back and replay a single level without changing their choices on the other levels. 

Mission Structure
The mission of the player (as Uncle Jack) is to overcome inaccessible obstacles in order to retrieve the keys that the sneaky cat stole.

Puzzle Structure
Each scene will contain an inaccessible obstacle that needs to be overcome by the player. The player will receive 4 options of how to overcome this obstacle and will be tasked with selecting the best option based on their budget. The user will have to be wise in their decisions and select the best combination of modifications in order to not run out of money by the end of the game. A history of the players past choices as a portion of their budget will be accessible when they hover over the budget tracker at the top of the screen. This will allow the player to have more visibility into how their choices affect the overall result of the game.
Mechanics
Rules
The player cannot go over their budget
An option must be selected at each level in order to advance, even if it is a no cost option

Model of the Game Universe
Each scene will be independent of each other. The modification selected on one scene will not affect the options the player has on the next, unless they run out of money and are forced to select the no cost option. Once the player has completed the game, they will receive more flexibility in being able to bounce between scenes to change their selections if they do so desire.

Physics
Since this is a 2D game, we will not need to make use of physics. Any physics-like animations will be created manually and not rely on a game engine to calculate the motion for us.

Economy
The player will be able to select their budget at the beginning of the game out of the options provided. Each budget will be sufficient to complete the game in a way that allows the player to successfully make a modification at each level and not go beyond their budget. With each selection the player makes, the budget will decrease based on the estimated cost of that modification. A history of these purchases will be recorded and displayed when the player hovers over the remaining budget presented on the screen.

Character Movement in the Game
The characters in Forever Home will be mostly static. Since this is a 2D game that does not rely on the player controlling the actual movement of the characters, most of the movement will be done through animations. For example, at the successful completion of each scene, the cat will move out of the scene and Uncle Jack will follow it. The characters will be seen moving from scene to scene and around the room, but the player will have no power to control these movements.

Objects
Not applicable.

Actions
This game will be controlled by mouse clicks to select the modification option the player would like to use to overcome the inaccessible obstacle. 

Combat
Not applicable.

Screen Flow
The game will open with a screen that allows the user to select which budget they would like to stick to when navigating through the game. Also, an overview of the levels (such as listing which rooms have to be modified) will be presented to the player in order for them to make a more educated decision on which budget they would like to select. Once selected, a backstory screen will be displayed, acquainting the user with their mission for the game. The first obstacle scene will then be presented to the player. Each obstacle scene will display a short description of what the obstacle is, then have buttons at the bottom of the screen that shows images of what the scene would look like with each of the different modification options. Once a modification is selected, and animation will show the construction of the modification and the screen will display an explanation of the effectiveness of the player’s choice, showing the number of points they earned for that scene. The next scene will then be displayed until the player completes all 5 scenes. At the end of the 5 scenes, there will be a summary screen displayed that evaluates the player’s performance as a whole.

Game Options
The player will be able to select their budget for modifications at the beginning of the game. This will influence which options they will be able to select for each scene since they won’t always be able to select the most expensive option based on their budget.

Replaying and Saving
The player will have the option to replay the game at the end if they would like to choose a different budget or make different selections in order to budget more wisely. There is no functionality to save a completed game. However, if the player is interested in only replaying a few levels instead of the whole game, their choices from the other levels will be preserved until they exit the game, signalling that they are finished playing it.

Story and Narrative
Back Story

Plot Elements
The more times Uncle Jack has to call Hannah, the more irritated she will become. This will be mostly portrayed in a comical way, but also emphasize Uncle Jack’s desire to not have to rely on Hannah in order to navigate throughout the home.

Game Story Progression
With each completed scene, Uncle Jack will get closer to retrieving the keys. However, if the player runs out of their budget, they will need to call Hannah to come help Uncle Jack navigate around the obstacle. Each time Hannah needs to be called, she will become more and more annoyed.
